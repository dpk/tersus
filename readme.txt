This is the Frontispiece (http://frontispiece.org/) port of Tersus (https://github.com/splorp/tersus), which removes even more cruft by simply not being WordPress.

Like the rest of Frontispiece, this particular edition of the Tersus theme is licensed under the MIT license, not the GPL. This is thanks to a copyleft exception kindly granted by Elliot Jay Stocks and the Tersus team.
